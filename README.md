ASSIGNMENT - RSVP MOVIES

Agenda- 
RSVP Movies is an Indian Film production company usually released many superhit movies for Indian audience now planning to release a movie for the global audience in 2020. 
Objective -
Working as an SQL expert I have to analyse the data and give the insight to RSVP Movies, the entire process has been divided into four segments where each segment leads to significant insight. 
Summary - 

Firstly, I load the dataset in my SQL workbench, As the analysis is divided into four segments,
	First Segment - In the first segment we check the dataset, shape and the null values in the movie column. For this segment my first priority is to find the best movies and the most viewed genre for Indian audience and also how many movies are produced in India and check the taste of the India audience. 
Suggestion: RSVP is good in Drama, Comedy, and Thriller. 
	Second Segment - In this segment my first priority is to check the top-rated movies, as we are planning to compete the global audience so its very important to understand their mindset and their taste. So, we also checked the top three production houses to know how they target the audience and on what genre they work on. We also checked the German and Italian movie, and we found German are getting higher votes than Italian. 
Suggestion to RSVP: Hire Dream Warrior Pictures or National Theatre Live as production House. 
	Third Segment - In this segment we are focusing on casting crew members, for any movie the backbone of the movie are Production House, Director, Actor and Actress. So we tried to find out the top director and the top production house who will going to direct the movie and the top 3 actor. As this movie is released by India so top three Indian Actor and Actress also required. 
Suggestion to RSVP: 1) James Mangold can be hired as the director for RSVP's next project.

3) Taapsee Pannu as actress.
